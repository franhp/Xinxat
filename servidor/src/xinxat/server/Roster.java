/* Roster

Roster is the name given to the list of contacts which appears in one's chat client.
 In Google Talk terms, it is the list of friends you would see once you login.
  The elements of the roster are your contacts. Each of these items is identified by 
  a unique identifier called JID (Jabber Identifier). JIDs have a syntax similar to that 
  of Email addresses, i.e., user@domain. The domain part in this identifier is usually 
  the server one connects to. In case of Google Talk, it is gmail.com or any of its domain aliases.

Rosters are stored on the server so that the XMPP client may retrieve the same each
 time the user logs in. Rosters are a type of IQ Stanza. (See IQ explanation.)
